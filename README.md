# CS-300-
DSA: Analysis and Design

Folders include Assignment activities for CS 300 on data structures vector, hash tables and binary trees.

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem to solve thourgh this course was learning and adapting code to the different approaches of data structures.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
Data structres are important because they will determine the amount of time our programs spends to be executed. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Referencing the reading activities helped me inmensely in breaking down any roadblocks that came up.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
The projects in this course has shown me to be more mindful in chosing my approach to the task by considering structures that I may not be familiar with. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
